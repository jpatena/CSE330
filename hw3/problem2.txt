// PROBLEM 2

// Treesort is a O(n log n) sorting function on average.
// Explain why in your own words. State your rational
// in concise and compelling language.

Adding all n elements of the vector into the search
tree can be done in O(n log n) steps. Because the traversal
to copy the elements back into the vector is linear, this means
the total running time of the algorithm is O(n log n).
